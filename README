Comp20 - Assignment 6: More Javascript Practice

Q: What is your opinion of Javascript as a programming language?
A: If you have a basic knowledge beforehand, I think Javascript is a 
relatively easy language to learn and understand, because it is 
very similar to C++. However, there are certain things that I find 
difficult, not because I can't understand, but there are certain 
functions that are associated with a particular effect. For 
example, the toFixed and the split, I feel like I had to know
their existence to be able to produce that specific effect. The main 
thing I don't like about Javascript is that it has no data type.
Because of this, when the assignment said pass in an array as a 
parameter, I originally put Array name[] but when I searched, it 
said to pass in just the name, name, and not even Array or the [].
This was very weird and unnatural to me, and I'm scared that I will 
accidently do this in my C++ homework. Otherwise I think Javascript
is a relatively easy language, and when you are more focused on 
HTML and CSS on web programming, I guess it is okay to be less
lenient on the syntax. I also like how it doesn't involve pointers.
